# Summary
From the results we can conclude that the surf and ice cream shop would be able to sustain the buisiness throughout the year. The temperature differences are not large enough to suggest a large decreases in demand from consumers. While demand is sure to be lower during December due to the potential temperature decreases, there are other golbal sisutations that may increase consumer demand for surfing and ice cream. 

### Additional Query Recommendations
It is recommended that the addtional queries be performed on the parcipiation and wind speeds to determine potential issues for the months of June and December.
